# Accident-locations-on-Indian-roads
 our project mainly focuses on ANALYSING ACCIDENT LOCATIONS ON INDIAN ROADS using machine learning. We utilized a dataset consisting of news articles with features such as Title, Text, Subject, and Date.
Here the road accident study is done by analyzing some data by giving some queries which is relevant to the study. The queries like what is the most dangerous time to drive  , what fractions of accidents occur in rural, urban and other areas. What is the trend in the number of accidents that occur each year,  do accidents in high speed limit areas have more casualties and so on
 These data can be accessed using Microsoft excel sheet and the required answer can be obtained. This analysis aims to highlight the data of the most importance in a road traffic accident and allow predictions to be made. The results from this methodology can be seen in the next section of the report.
